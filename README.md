I began by pseudocoding.  Once I started building the actual code:
* There was an HTML file to start
* I created a placeholder for 'currentTime' in the HTML file
* I referenced the existing HTML elements that I needed to use ('container', 'currentDay', and 'currentTime')
* I used Moment.js to set the current day and current time on top, placed in the jumbotron
* I put the time (for display) in hourArray.
* Within 'container', add time blocks
* Within time blocks, add textarea for todos
* Add save button for input to be saved
* I added a save image to the button
* Use local storage to save tasks
* Color code hours by past, present, and future using Moment.JS
* For new day, clear old tasks

In terms of functionality, 
* I got help from a tutor to get Moment.JS and the hourArray2 to be comparable, so that the time blocks could be color-coded.
* I got help from the Teaching Assistant because the color-coding reference was using applying the same color to 
the whole class (when I needed it to be 3 different colors for past, present, future).
* The professor helped point out that the code could be simplified (removing the jQuery $ once the variable was declared for instance).
I used that and some other things that we learned to condense the code.
* It appears to be responsive when the screen size shrinks.
* The textarea accepts inputs.  But it is coming up undefined, which may be why it is not responding to populate the array for saving.
* The professor started helping with local storage, but we ran out of time.  

Similar to my classmates, I have consistently been spending 20 hours per week on homework assignments, in addition 
to another 20 hours reading and reviewing previous lessons.  I am so lucky that there was not a full-time course when I was ready to start the class.  The part-time class has definitely been full-time for me.
